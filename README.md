In the first exercise we create the convex hull of the corresponding points using Andrews variant of the Graham scan.
We output the visualization of the convex hull:

In the second exercise we ask the user to input the value for lambda and the convex hull is created based on that value.
In the terminal we also output the length.
The visualization below corresponds for lambda=5.

In the third exercise we create the convex hull based on the Jarvis March algorithm and output the visualization 
of the hull.
